# Introduction to coding with Python

This course is designed to give kids (8 and above) some simple coding concepts using Python (as a programming language). This is a self-paced course so kids can follow the guidance in each lesson on their own. Each lesson consist of a few sections and each section will cover a specific topic which builds on. Each student should complete the excercise in each topic.

These are what this course focus on:

* Variables
* Syntax
* Control flow

This is a very much beginner course, so no prior experience in coding is required. I do hope this helps each student learn about coding!
