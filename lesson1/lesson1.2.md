# Lesson 1.2

1. When we store pieces of data in memory. This is called: Declaring a variable. 
2. A variable can store numbers, text or other data types.

Example of storing a number.

```python
num = 1
```

Example of storing a string. Notice we need to use double quotes around the text.

```python
name = "My name is David."
```

This allows us to do interesting things such as adding 2 numbers together.

```python
num1 = 1
num2 = 3
numTotal = num1 + num2
print(numTotal)
```

This will output 4. The + sign used for adding is also called an operator. The following are syntax for the different operators.

| Syntax  | Desciption |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| +  | Add  |
| -  | Minus  |
| /  | Divide  |
| *  | Multiply  |
