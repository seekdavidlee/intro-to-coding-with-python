# Lesson 1.1

Here are some key ideas to know about before writing any code.

1. A computer has a few components. Two interesting components are what we call Memory and Central Processing Unit (CPU).
2. When you write code, sometimes you need to hold some pieces of data somewhere. This is what we call Memory.
3. When you are ready to do some computation such as adding two numbers together, this is where you need CPU.
4. To write code, you will need to learn the grammer of the programming language. This is called Syntax.

We will begin with learning the following syntax for Python.

| Syntax  | Desciption |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| \(  | Open bracket  |
| \)  | Close bracket  |
| \"  | Double quotes  |
| print  | Keyword used in Python to output text |

For example, someone might say the following: 

print, open bracket, double quotes, I am here, close double quotes, and close bracket

```
print("I am here")
```

This is usually how a programmer might spell out the code. By the way, the code above will print out "I am here".
