# Concatenating 2 variables

firstName = "James"
lastName = "Anderson"

name = firstName + " " + lastName
print(name)

# Declare 2 variables for Jackson and Walker. Do not use the variables from above. Choose your own variable name. Use string concatenation to make "Walker, Jackson" and print the result. Notice I added a comma.
