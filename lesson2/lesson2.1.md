# Lesson 2.1

1. We learned about operators in the previous lesson. We can also use operators to combine string variables into a single variable. This is useful if we need to combine variables together to display a full name.
2. The action to combine string variables is also called string concatenation.

Example of combining First and Last Name. 

```python
firstName = "James"
lastName = "Anderson"

name = firstName + " " + lastName
print(name)
```

Notice we are adding a space in between the 2 variables firstName and lastName? What do you think would happen without that space? Try it out on your own.
